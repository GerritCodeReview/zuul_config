Also, every change to that configuration (including adding the job initially) is self-testing.\n\nAdding it here reduces dotfiles in other repos and lets folks managing the CI infrastructure see and control it all from one place.  So far, I think that has been more comfortable for folks since it mirrors the Jenkins setup.",
