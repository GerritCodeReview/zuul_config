      "message": "Okay, I think I know what happened: Zuul reloads its configuration when it sees a .zuul.yaml change proposed or merge (this is why 2.16 worked as expected).  But it doesn\u0027t see the .zuul.yaml change in merge commits, so it didn\u0027t notice the merge-ups to the other branches.\n\nTo fix the immediate problem, I have forced a full-reconfiguration, and it now sees the configuration on every branch.  I also re-ran the checks for the 2 open plugins/task changes; they\u0027re running now, you should see results soon.\n\nIf you make any changes to .zuul.yaml via merge commits this will happen again; I\u0027ll work on a change to Zuul to handle this case.\n\nI think we can abandon this change.\n",
