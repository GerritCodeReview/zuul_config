      "message": "Since this repo is a config-project and not an untrusted-project, this change would need to merge before it will take effect.\n\nIt is possible to have both a centrally defined project config as well as in-repo config.  As an alternative to this change, if you simply copy the entire image-diff project stanza as updated in this change into a .zuul.yaml (or similar) file in the image-diff repo, then the in-repo config would merge with this central config, and produce the outcome you want in a speculative environment.  Optionally, you could remove the project-config section here.\n\nAnyway, none of that is necessary -- just noting that is a path to speculative execution of config changes like this (which is worth doing if you anticipate more of them).",
